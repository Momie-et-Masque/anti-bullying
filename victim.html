  <h1>What should you do if you get bullyied ?</h1>
  <p>Here is what you should do if you get bullied, once or repeatedly, at school :
    <ul>
      <li>Do not wait for it to get worse.</li>
      <li>Talk about it to an adult. It can be a teacher or a supervisor. Their only goal is to help you and make you feel safe.</li>
      <li>If you are too shy or ashamed to speak, do not worry : nothing bad can happen if you tell an adult, try to surpass that barrier.</li>
    </ul>
